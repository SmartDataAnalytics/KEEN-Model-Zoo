KGE Models for ComPath
======================

This directory contains KGE models trained on ComPath [1]. The ComPath dataset contains inter- and intra-database pathway mappings
that represent equivalent and hierarchically related pathways. The resources included
in ComPath are Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG),
Reactome, and WikiPathways. To map equivalences and hierarchies of
biological pathways, the *equivalentTo* and *isPartOf* relationship were introduced.

Following figure shows hierarchies between pathways:
