KGE Model for ComPath
=====================
In this experiment the TransE model was trained on ComPath[1], and the experiment was reported in [2,3].
The corresponding results are saved in `evaluation_summary.json <https://github.com/SmartDataAnalytics/KEEN-Model-Zoo/blob/master/bioinformatics/ComPath/compath_model_01/evaluation_summary.json>`_., and the hyper-parameter values can be found in `configuration.json <https://github.com/SmartDataAnalytics/KEEN-Model-Zoo/blob/master/bioinformatics/ComPath/compath_model_01/configuration.json>`_
